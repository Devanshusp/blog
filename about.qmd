Hey, I’m Devanshu Sen Pandey.
I grew up in Delhi, Ann Arbor, and Saint Louis.
I am currently studying computer science, statistics, and neuroscience at Grinnell College.
My goals in life are to see my friends and family thrive, contribute to making humanity multiplanetary, and live long enough to pop a bottle (of diet coke) on my 200th birthday.
